I spend my days building AI-powered tools for the legal industry. When I learned about the Blockchain Legal Institute's Legal Tech Hackathon and the opportunity to judge, I was immediately interested. Hackathons have always fascinated me—the energy, the creativity, the pressure of building something meaningful in a short time.

I've judged hackathons before. I am familiar with the process: quick-fire presentations, ambitious projects, and the exhilarating energy of individuals creating something innovative under pressure. But judging a legal tech hackathon? That was different. This wasn't just about evaluating code quality or system architecture. It was about assessing solutions to real legal compliance challenges through the lens of blockchain technology.

## The World's First Legal Tech Blockchain Hackathon

[LegalHack 2025](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/legal-hack/detail), hosted by the Blockchain Legal Institute (BLI) in partnership with Constellation Network, Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), and Story Protocol, billed itself as the world's first legal technology hackathon focused on blockchain applications. The numbers alone were impressive: **320 hackers** from around the globe, **91 projects** submitted, and over **$32,000 in bounties** up for grabs.

The challenge was clear but ambitious: build solutions that address legal compliance challenges using blockchain technology. Participants had to demonstrate technical expertise across AI, blockchain integration, smart contracts, and decentralized applications—all while showing how their ideas could solve real-world problems.

For me, this meant evaluating projects not just as a software engineer, but as someone who works in the legal tech space daily. I had to assess both the technical implementation and whether the solutions actually addressed real legal challenges.

## A Truly Global Effort

One of the most striking aspects of LegalHack 2025 was its global reach. Hackers joined from South America, North America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The virtual format made this possible, bringing together perspectives I wouldn't have encountered at a traditional in-person event.

This diversity wasn't just geographic; it was jurisdictional. Legal compliance looks different depending on where you are in the world. A solution designed for European data protection regulations might approach the problem differently than one built for American corporate law or Latin American financial regulations. Seeing teams tackle these challenges in their context made the hackathon richer.

The BLI team facilitated this global collaboration through Discord, where we hosted twice-weekly help sessions during the hackathon. These sessions became more than just Q&A—they were spaces where hackers shared ideas, asked questions, and received feedback from judges like me. I'd pop in to offer suggestions or point someone toward a better approach for their smart contract implementation. Watching these interactions unfold across time zones reminded me that innovation thrives when people from different backgrounds work on challenging problems together.

## The Judging Experience

Virtual pitch day arrived on November 15th. My task: evaluate **57 projects** built on Constellation Network, ICP, and Story Protocol, focusing on **13 project** pitches where teams presented their work.

Judging a legal tech hackathon felt different from other hackathons I've evaluated. With most hackathons, I can focus heavily on the technical implementation—is the product scalable? Are they using the right tools? But here, I also had to ask: **Does this team actually understand the legal problem they're solving?**

Some projects demonstrated impressive technical implementations, yet their legal applicability fell short. Others had a profound understanding of legal challenges but struggled with the technical execution. The best projects, the ones that really stood out, nailed both.

## What I Learned

Building interdisciplinary solutions is challenging. You need to speak two languages—in this case, legal and technical. You need to understand the constraints of both worlds.

Global collaboration also left an impression on me. The Discord community, the help sessions, the time-zone-spanning conversations—all of it reminded me that the best ideas don't come from isolated genius. They come from people with different perspectives working together, learning from each other, and pushing each other forward.

## A Note of Thanks

Events like LegalHack 2025 don't just happen. They require vision, coordination, and a lot of behind-the-scenes work. I want to thank Jacqui Cooper and the entire Blockchain Legal Institute team for putting such a hackathon together. Creating the world's first legal tech blockchain hackathon is no small feat—bringing together 320 hackers globally, coordinating with major blockchain protocols, and fostering a community where legal and technical minds could collaborate.

Thanks also to Constellation Network, Internet Computer Protocol, and Story Protocol for supporting this initiative and providing the infrastructure that made these innovations possible.

## Looking Forward

LegalHack 2025 was a snapshot of where legal tech and blockchain are heading. The projects I evaluated weren't just experiments—they were glimpses of a future where legal work is faster, more transparent, and more accessible.

But more than that, the hackathon reinforced something I've been thinking about a lot lately: traditional industries need innovators. People who care about solving real problems in industries that have been underserved by technology.

## Stay Curious

Judging LegalHack taught me that the best innovation happens at intersections—where different fields, perspectives, and technologies meet.

The best ideas don't come from staying comfortable. They come from staying curious. So here's my question for you: **What traditional industry could benefit from the tech skills you already have?**

Think about it. Then go build something.

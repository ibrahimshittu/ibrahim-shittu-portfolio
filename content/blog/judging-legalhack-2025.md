I spend my days building AI-powered tools for the legal industry. When I learned about the Blockchain Legal Institute's Legal Tech Hackathon and the opportunity to judge, I was immediately interested. Hackathons have always fascinated me—the energy, the creativity, the pressure of building something meaningful in a short time.

I've judged hackathons before. I know the drill: rapid-fire pitches, ambitious projects, the electric energy of people building something new under pressure. But judging a **legal tech** hackathon? That was different. This wasn't just about evaluating code quality or system architecture. It was about assessing solutions to real legal compliance challenges—in my own industry—through the lens of blockchain technology.

## The World's First Legal Tech Blockchain Hackathon

LegalHack 2025, hosted by the Blockchain Legal Institute (BLI) in partnership with Constellation Network, Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), and Story Protocol, billed itself as the world's first legal technology hackathon focused on blockchain applications. The numbers alone were impressive: **320 hackers** from around the globe, **91 projects** submitted, and over **$32,000 in bounties** up for grabs.

The challenge was clear but ambitious: build solutions that address legal compliance challenges using blockchain technology. Participants had to demonstrate technical expertise across AI, blockchain integration, smart contracts, and decentralized applications—all while showing how their ideas could solve real-world problems.

For me, this meant evaluating projects not just as a software engineer, but as someone who works in the legal tech space daily. I had to assess both the technical implementation and whether the solutions actually addressed real legal challenges.

## A Truly Global Effort

One of the most striking aspects of LegalHack 2025 was its global reach. Hackers joined from South America, North America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The virtual format made this possible, bringing together perspectives I wouldn't have encountered at a traditional in-person event.

This diversity wasn't just geographic—it was jurisdictional. Legal compliance looks different depending on where you are in the world. A solution designed for European data protection regulations might approach the problem differently than one built for American corporate law or Latin American financial regulations. Seeing teams tackle these challenges from their own contexts made the hackathon richer.

The BLI team facilitated this global collaboration through Discord, where we hosted twice-weekly help sessions during the hackathon. These sessions became more than just Q&A—they were spaces where hackers shared ideas, asked technical questions, and received feedback from judges like me. I'd pop in to offer suggestions or point someone toward a better approach for their smart contract implementation. Watching these interactions unfold across time zones reminded me that innovation thrives when people from different backgrounds work on hard problems together.

## The Judging Experience

Virtual pitch day arrived on November 15th. My task: evaluate **57 projects** built on Constellation Network, ICP, and Story Protocol, focusing on **13 project pitches** where teams presented their work.

Judging a legal tech hackathon felt different from other hackathons I've evaluated. With most hackathons, I can focus heavily on the technical implementation—Is the product scalable? Are they using the right tools? But here, I also had to ask: **Does this team actually understand the legal problem they're solving?**

Some projects had brilliant technical implementations but missed the mark on legal applicability. Others had a deep understanding of legal challenges but struggled with the technical execution. The best projects—the ones that really stood out—nailed both.

I found myself asking questions I don't usually ask in other hackathons. How well did they implement their solution? Was the blockchain integration thoughtful, or just tacked on? Would this scale? Could a legal team actually deploy and use this? Does this solve a real problem, or is it a solution looking for a problem?

One challenge I hadn't anticipated: evaluating across **three different blockchain protocols**. Constellation Network, ICP, and Story Protocol each have their own strengths, quirks, and design philosophies. A project built on ICP's architecture might look very different from one on Constellation, even if they're solving similar problems.

## What Surprised Me Most

Honestly, I expected a mix of quality. Hackathons are time-constrained, high-pressure environments. But the **91 projects** submitted weren't just weekend hacks—they were thoughtful, ambitious solutions to real problems.

The **technical innovation** was impressive. Teams demonstrated expertise in AI automation, smart contract development, decentralized identity systems, and more. Many projects integrated multiple cutting-edge technologies: blockchain for immutability, AI for document analysis, zero-knowledge proofs for privacy. These weren't toy projects—they were production-minded.

The **team presentations** also stood out. Communicating complex legal-tech concepts is hard. You're bridging two worlds: the technical (blockchain, smart contracts, distributed systems) and the legal (compliance, regulations, audit trails). The best teams made it look easy. They spoke the language of both developers and lawyers, which is exactly what this space needs.

But the biggest surprise? **How blockchain is reimagining legal processes**, not just digitizing them.

I'd gone in thinking, "blockchain + legal tech = putting legal documents on a blockchain." That's not wrong, but it's incomplete. The best projects weren't just taking existing legal workflows and adding blockchain. They were **rethinking how legal processes could work** when you have immutability, transparency, and decentralization as foundational primitives.

For example, instead of just storing contracts on a blockchain, teams were building systems where contracts could self-execute based on verifiable conditions, where audit trails were built-in by default, where multiple parties could collaborate on sensitive documents without a central authority. That's a fundamentally different way of thinking about legal work.

## Why Blockchain Matters for Legal Tech

For those less familiar with blockchain, let me briefly explain why it's compelling for legal applications.

At Finiti, we use AI to help lawyers draft and review complex documents like 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and prospectuses. Our focus is on making legal work faster, more accurate, and less tedious. Blockchain offers something complementary: **trust and transparency** in legal processes.

Here's why it matters:

**Immutability for record-keeping**: Once something is written to a blockchain, it can't be changed or deleted. For legal documents, contracts, or compliance records, this creates an indisputable audit trail. You can prove exactly when a document was created, who signed it, and whether it's been tampered with.

**Smart contracts for automated compliance**: Smart contracts are self-executing agreements where the terms are written in code. Imagine a compliance rule that automatically triggers when certain conditions are met—no manual oversight needed. This reduces human error and speeds up processes.

**Transparency for audit trails**: In traditional systems, proving compliance often means digging through logs, emails, and document versions. With blockchain, the entire history is transparent and verifiable. Auditors can see exactly what happened, when, and why.

**Decentralization for reducing single points of failure**: Legal systems often rely on centralized authorities (governments, corporations, law firms). Blockchain distributes that trust across a network, making systems more resilient and less dependent on any single entity.

Just as AI is transforming how lawyers work with documents, blockchain is transforming how legal processes themselves operate. And that's what made judging this hackathon so fascinating—I was seeing the next wave of legal tech innovation unfold in real time.

## Technology Transforming Traditional Industries

Legal tech is part of a much bigger story: **traditional industries discovering what happens when you combine them with emerging technology**.

The legal sector has historically been conservative and slow to adopt new technology. Law firms still use processes that haven't changed much in decades. But that's shifting. AI, blockchain, and automation are forcing the industry to evolve—not because it's trendy, but because the efficiency gains are too significant to ignore.

This pattern isn't unique to legal. Look around:

- **Finance**: Blockchain and DeFi are reimagining banking, payments, and asset management.
- **Healthcare**: AI and decentralized health records are transforming patient care and medical research.
- **Real estate**: Smart contracts are streamlining property transactions and reducing intermediaries.
- **Government**: Blockchain-based identity systems and transparent public records are modernizing civic infrastructure.

The common thread? **Traditional industries + emerging tech = massive opportunity**. But there's a catch: the best solutions come from people who understand **both** the technology **and** the industry.

Judging LegalHack reinforced this for me. The projects that wowed me weren't built by people who only knew blockchain, or only knew law. They were built by teams who understood legal compliance challenges deeply and used blockchain thoughtfully to solve them. The technology was in service of the problem, not the other way around.

## What Judging Legal Tech Taught Me

Judging hackathons in other domains—like general web dev, mobile apps, or AI—is one thing. Judging a **legal tech** hackathon required me to think differently.

In most hackathons, I can lean heavily on my technical instincts. Does this code work? Is it scalable? Is the architecture sound? But in legal tech, I also had to ask: **Does this make sense for lawyers? For compliance teams? For legal departments?** Technical excellence alone wasn't enough—it had to serve a real legal need.

Seeing innovation in my own industry from the **evaluator's perspective** was humbling. When you're building, you're focused on shipping features, fixing bugs, and meeting deadlines. When you're judging, you get to step back and see the broader landscape. You notice patterns. You see where the industry is headed. You gain perspective on what actually matters.

Another lesson: **building interdisciplinary solutions is hard**. Really hard. You need to speak two languages—in this case, legal and technical. You need to understand the constraints of both worlds. The teams that succeeded weren't just good coders or good legal minds; they were good translators.

Global collaboration also left an impression on me. The Discord community, the help sessions, the time-zone-spanning conversations—all of it reminded me that the best ideas don't come from isolated genius. They come from people with different perspectives working together, learning from each other, and pushing each other forward.

Finally, I learned that **judges aren't just gatekeepers**. Yes, we evaluate projects and help determine winners. But during those twice-weekly help sessions, we were also mentors, guides, and sounding boards. I'd answer questions about Azure infrastructure, suggest better ways to structure smart contracts, or help teams think through product-market fit. That mentorship aspect made judging feel less like passing judgment and more like supporting a community of builders.

## Looking Forward

LegalHack 2025 was a snapshot of where legal tech and blockchain are heading. The projects I evaluated weren't just experiments—they were glimpses of a future where legal work is faster, more transparent, and more accessible.

But more than that, the hackathon reinforced something I've been thinking about a lot lately: **traditional industries need technical innovators**. Not people who want to "disrupt" for disruption's sake, but people who care about solving real problems in industries that have been underserved by technology.

If you're a developer, designer, or technologist reading this, I encourage you to look beyond conventional tech spaces. Don't just build another social media app or productivity tool. Ask yourself: **What traditional industry could benefit from the tech skills I already have?**

Maybe it's legal, like LegalHack. Maybe it's healthcare, education, agriculture, or logistics. Whatever it is, there's a massive opportunity for people who are willing to learn a new domain, understand its challenges, and apply technology thoughtfully.

## Stay Curious

Judging LegalHack taught me that the best innovation happens at **intersections**—where different fields, perspectives, and technologies meet.

I didn't expect to learn as much as I did. I went in thinking I'd evaluate projects and provide feedback. I left with a deeper appreciation for how blockchain is reshaping legal processes, how global collaboration drives innovation, and how important it is to understand both the technology and the domain you're working in.

If you've been building in the same space for years, consider stepping outside your comfort zone. Judge a hackathon in a domain you're unfamiliar with. Attend a conference that's not your usual crowd. Build something for an industry you've never worked in before.

The best ideas don't come from staying comfortable. They come from staying curious.

So here's my question for you: **What traditional industry could benefit from the tech skills you already have?**

Think about it. Then go build something.

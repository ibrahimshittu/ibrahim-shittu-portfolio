### Session Overview

"Getting Started with AEC Automation: Computational BIM and Beyond" was designed to take participants through how innovative technologies are improving AEC workflows to achieve more efficient, effective results for quality-assured project execution and sustainable solutions. This learning session guided attendees through automating repetitive tasks while exploring the future of work and providing long-lasting innovative solutions for the AEC Industry.

### What I Covered

The presentation was structured to provide practical, actionable knowledge that professionals could immediately apply to their workflows:

#### 1. Automation: The Future of Work

- Understanding what AEC automation really means
- Why automation is crucial for the African construction industry
- The difference between traditional workflows and automated processes

#### 2. Technology Stack for AEC

- Introduction to Dynamo and Grasshopper for visual programming
- Python programming fundamentals for AEC professionals
- Computational design principles and generative design
- Machine learning applications in the AEC industry

#### 3. Case Study/Demo

- Live demonstration of automating repetitive tasks
- Creating complex geometry through computational methods
- Accessing data from Revit and dynamic Python scripts with the Revit API
- Practical examples of time-saving automation workflows
- Visual scripting using Dynamo for Revit
- Pushing and pulling custom data to/from Revit projects into generative workflows

### Key Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, attendees gained the ability to:

- Confidently create Visual Programming scripts to automate repetitive tasks
- Implement high-end technologies into their workflows
- Provide long-lasting digital solutions for the AEC Industry
- Understand the ABC of visual scripting using Dynamo
- Access the Revit API with Python for custom automation
- Explore C# Add-Ins development for advanced functionality
- Apply artificial intelligence concepts in the AEC Industry

## The African AEC Revolution

BIM Harambee Africa 2020 was an ambitious undertaking - a full month of BIM presentations, learning sessions, and panel discussions designed to accelerate BIM knowledge across the continent. The organizers set out to focus on what BIM means to Africa's development and to highlight the people raising the BIM tide across the continent.

With 42 presentation sessions, 6 learning sessions, and 5 panel discussions, the conference received an overwhelming response, welcoming 58 speakers and contributors to the 2020 event themed "The Digital Disruption." What made this particularly exciting was the broad range of topics covered from October 5-30, the diversity of African countries represented, and the varied backgrounds and expertise of the speakers.

This conference represented more than just a speaking opportunity - it was a testament to Africa's growing prominence in digital construction and BIM adoption.

## Key Takeaways for AEC Professionals

#### 1. Start Small, Think Big

You don't need to revolutionize your entire workflow overnight. Begin with automating simple, repetitive tasks and gradually build your capabilities.

#### 2. Programming is Your Gateway

Learning to code transforms how you approach AEC challenges. Python provides an accessible entry point for data extraction and geometric operations, while C# enables deeper integration with Revit through custom add-ins and plugins. Whether you're scripting with Python for quick automation tasks or developing comprehensive C# applications for enterprise solutions, programming bridges the gap between design intent and execution. The combination of visual programming (Dynamo/Grasshopper) with text-based coding (Python/C#) creates a powerful toolkit for any level of automation complexity.

#### 3. Community Matters

The African BIM community is vibrant and supportive. Engaging with peers accelerates learning and creates opportunities for collaboration on innovative projects.

## Gratitude and Recognition

I'm deeply grateful to the BIM Harambee team and everyone who made this event possible. Their dedication to advancing digital construction in Africa is truly inspiring.

## Impact and Legacy

This presentation has had a lasting impact on the African AEC community and beyond. The recording continues to serve as an educational resource for AEC professionals globally, helping them understand and implement automation in their workflows. Through this conference, I connected with innovators across Africa's construction industry, establishing valuable networks that continue to drive collaboration and knowledge exchange. The presentation helped establish my presence in the African BIM and computational design community as a thought leader, while contributing to the democratization of AEC automation knowledge across the continent.

## Looking Forward

The future of AEC in Africa is bright. As we continue to embrace digital transformation, the possibilities are endless. Whether it's using AI for structural optimization, implementing IoT for smart buildings, or leveraging VR/AR for design visualization, the tools and knowledge shared in this presentation form the foundation for these innovations.
